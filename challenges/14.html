  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Alpha";
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "Beta";
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Delta";
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Gamma";
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 1;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};;

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const chris = {
        name: "Chris",
        age: 30,
        social: {
            twitter: "@iamchrisburnell",
            mastodon: "@chrisburnell@mastodon.social"
        }
    };

    console.log(chris);

    const developer = Object.assign({}, chris, { name: "Developer", age: 99 });
    console.log(chris, developer);
